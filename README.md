# IVD Version 2.0 a.k.a All in one ML

This is an improvement over my previous project which can be found [here](https://github.com/charlescsr/implogn-visintei-datifing)

The app contains 3 modules:
* Preprocessing (Upload the dataset and perform normalization algorithms on a set of columns)
* Pickling (Select a ML algorithm and customise with some parameters)
* Cross Validation (Perform Cross Validation on the dataset using the model file)
